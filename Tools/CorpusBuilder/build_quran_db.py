"""Build the bundled Quran database.

Writes `ThawabForGod/Resources/Corpus/quran.sqlite` — the Uthmani text of the
Quran and the metadata a reader needs to navigate it:

- `surah`  — the 114 chapters: names, verse counts, where and when revealed,
             and the basmala each one opens with.
- `verse`  — all 6,236 verses, keyed by chapter and number, each carrying the
             divisions it falls in (juz, hizb, rub el hizb, mushaf page) and a
             search-normalized copy of its text.
- `juz`, `hizb`, `rub_el_hizb` — the reciter's divisions, as ranges to jump to.

Two FTS5 indexes come with it — `verse_fts` over the normalized text and
`surah_fts` over the three name spellings — built here rather than on device,
because an index over a read-only corpus is as static as the corpus is.

**Two Tanzil texts go in, and they do different jobs.** The Uthmani text is what
the app *draws* — it is the mushaf, and it is stored verbatim. It is the wrong
thing to *search*, because Uthmani orthography writes a whole class of words
without the alef a reader types: the mushaf spells ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ, and stripping its
diacritics leaves `السموت`, which nobody will ever type. So `text_normalized` is
built from Tanzil's Simple Clean text — the same verses in modern imla’i
spelling — folded by `normalize`. Searching "السماوات" then finds the verse whose
displayed text is ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ, which is the whole point.

Its own file rather than more tables in `corpus.sqlite`, which
`Resources/Corpus/README.md` anticipated: the text is an order of magnitude
larger than everything else in there put together, it has a different upstream
and a different licence, and `CorpusDatabase` is constructed with a resource
name and knows nothing about what is inside it.

Both inputs come from the Tanzil Project (https://tanzil.net) and are used
verbatim — see the README for the terms, which require that and require the
attribution the app carries in Settings → Sources.

Nothing is edited by hand. Re-running this script reproduces the database from
scratch, which is what makes a correction reviewable.

# (The Tazkiya Tech Quran SDK, working from the same upstream, makes the same

#
# There is deliberately no basmala string written out below. It is read from
# verse 1:1, which *is* the basmala, and a prefix is recognised by comparing
# letters with the diacritics removed — because two chapters, Al-Tin and
# Al-Qadr, carry an extra shadda on the opening ba (the idgham from the end of
# the preceding chapter, a recitation mark of the Madina text) and because the
# order of combining marks in a literal pasted into this file is not something
